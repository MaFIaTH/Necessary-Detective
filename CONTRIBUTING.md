# About contribution
I do not expect many contributions, this is just a book project after all. However, there are some ways that you can help me such as correcting grammar, paraphrasing, formatting or even better, a new HTML webpage! Also, if you are not convenient to fix the problem, you can always submit an issue report such as plot hole, plot inconsistency, offensive material and so on. Every helps are greatly appreciated!

## How to contribute
1. I recommend you to download .docx file and edit them using Microsoft Word 2013 or higher, however you can try using different software as long as the output file is .docx and still retaining format. (I might change this to something more flexible in the future but I have no idea, you can suggest me.) (For HTML version, I will handle that myself. Still, if you have any suggestion regarding this, pray tell.)
2. Before you submit your edit, I suggest you use these emojis styling for easier identification:
    - 🔨 `:hammer` for grammar/spelling correction
    - 🅰️ `:a` for paraphrasing (changing vocab fits into this category)
    - 📄 `:page_facing_up` for formatting change.
    - 🌐 `:globe_with_meridians` for website coding (Anything language other than HTML is also acceptable).
    - 🔖 `:bookmark` for markdown edit such as README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, etc.
    - 💻 `:computer` for coding unrelated to website (Don't know what is the use of this but added just in case).
    - 🤷 `:shrug` for anything that doesn't fit in any category above.
3. I ***heavily*** suggest you to write a clear and desriptive title and description of your commit, for example:
    - ❌ 
      ```
      🔨 fix grammar 
      Fix some grammar problems
      ```
    - ✔️ 
      ```
      🔨 fix grammartical problem in Macro-lore and Micro-lore
      Correcting grammar and spelling in these sections:
      - Macro-lore up until Notable Technologies subcategory
      - Entire Micro-lore category
      ```
4. If your commit is to fix the reported issue, please reference the issue in the title as well.
5. After checking thoroughly, commit to a new branch and submit pull request.
6. Check you pull request often, I might have some suggestions for your commit.
7. If there is no problem then your commit will be merged. Congratulation!🥳

## How to report issue
1. Before you submit your issue report, consider using these emojis for easier identification:
    - 🕳️ `:hole` for plot hole.
    - 💫 `:dizzy` for plot/logic inconsistency.
    - 🙅 `:no_good` for offensive material.
    - 🤷 `:shrug` for anything that doesn't fit in any category above.
2. I ***heavily*** suggest you to write a clear and desriptive title and description of your issue report, for example:
    - ❌ 
      ```
      💫 Found some logic inconsistencies.
      John Doe testimony doesn't sound right to me, can you check on that?
      ```
    - ✔️ 
      ```
      💫 logic inconsistencies in witness testimony in case 4.
      John Doe mentioned that he had been to one of the casinos last night which soon after turned out to be a lie. 
      However, Lucas directly assumed that he had never been to any casino at all and had no alibi, which I think is incorrect. 
      First, Lucas has no evidence saying that he never went to the casino. 
      Second, the negation of "one of something" is not just "none" but can be "more than one" or "all", 
      so maybe John Doe had gone to more than one casinos that night but had to lie to hide his obscenity.
      ```
3. If possible, you can give your suggestion on how to solve the issue.
4. If needed, you can reference to another issue or pull request as well.
5. After checking thoroughly, submit your issue report.
6. Check you issue report often, I might have some discussions for you.
7. If the issue is fixed, your issue report will be closed. Congratulation!🥳
