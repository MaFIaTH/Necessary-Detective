# Necessary Detective 1

## Story Outline

**Necessary Detective** is a detective story/game set on the secret US island territory of Epistimia, where technology and innovation are the primary focus.
Unusually, one city on the island has had a consistently low crime rate for the past 13 years.
Many researchers have been perplexed by this phenomenon because no scientific explanation has been found.

**Lucas Aeres Ho**, a local photographer and also theÂ protagonist, was hired by a college friend to photograph his proposal to his girlfriend.
It appears to be a routine job for Lucas, but little does he know that he will become the city's first detective to solve a murder in 13 years 
and uncover an obscene and shocking truth behind the mysterious phenomenon.

## Disclaimer

- Necessary Detective is my first piece of fiction, also I'm a non-native English speaker. Given this, my grammar and vocabulary are somewhat limited.
- Some sections of the story may contain references to video games because I originally intended to turn this story into a video game at some point in the future.
- This project is expected to be completed by 2026, before but not after I graduate from college.
- Hope you have fun with the story! (providing that I make this project public at all lol).
